                <p>As a Product Owner, my responsibility is to work with the development team to meet roadmap milestones
                    set by the executive director. With my development and testing experience, I am able to speak the
                    language of the development team. Together we write Jira epics and tasks to accomplish the business
                    goals. I refine the backlog and set the priority with the direction of the executive director. I am
                    available to the team to resolve any impediments. The team delivers business value after each two
                    week Sprint. I attend the Scrum events and conduct user acceptance testing. I create product videos,
                    animated GIFs, and feature pages to communicate the change to all of Kaplan.</p>
