# About Me

I am a Product Owner at Kaplan.

As a Product Owner, my responsibility is to work with the development team to meet roadmap milestones set by the executive director. With my development and testing experience, I am able to speak the language of the development team. Together we write Jira epics and tasks to accomplish the business goals. I refine the backlog and set the priority with the direction of the executive director. I am available to the team to resolve any impediments. The team delivers business value after each two week Sprint. I attend the Scrum events and conduct user acceptance testing. I create product videos, animated GIFs, and feature pages to communicate the change to all of Kaplan.
