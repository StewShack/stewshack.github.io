            7.0 Your rights
        </p>
        <p>
            7.1 In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the
            rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should
            read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:
        </p>
        <p>
            ( a ) the right to access;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( b ) the right to rectification;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( c ) the right to erasure;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( d ) the right to restrict processing;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( e ) the right to object to processing;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( f ) the right to data portability;
        </p>
        <p>
            ( g ) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
        </p>
        <p>
            ( h ) the right to withdraw consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do,
            access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information
            includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the
            recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will
            supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional
            copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the
            purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those
            circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
            were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
            processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing
            purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed]. However, there are exclusions of the right
            to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: [for exercising the right of
            freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
            exercise or defence of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
            circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose
            erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal
            data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing,
            pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may
            continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
            legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
            particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing
            is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any
            official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
            party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can
            demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
            freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes
            (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process
            your personal data for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical
            research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the
            processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
        </p>
        <p>
            ( a ) consent; or
        </p>
        <p>
            ( b ) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order
            to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by
            automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
            machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and
            freedoms of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you
            have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You
            may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
            infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have
            the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing
            before the withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by email notice to us.
