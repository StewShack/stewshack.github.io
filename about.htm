            I began typing at a very young age.

            In 1998, my dad bought an email account through an Internet Service Provider. Along with the email came 5 MB
            of website storage.
            I learned HTML and quickly filled the website with animated gifs.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>First Content Job</h2>
        <p>
            With two days of HTML experience, I landed a job as a Web Content Administrator at the <a
                href="https://www.stwnewspress.com">Stillwater News Press</a>.
            At that time they called me a "Webmaster". I was responsible for publishing the daily newspaper articles to
            the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that point on, I was addicted to the Web. I built websites for the Human Resource Management
            Association at Oklahoma State University.
            I also built a site for the Student Academic Mentor program.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was my senior year at OSU and switching to a computer science major was not in the cards. I completed my
            degree and worked for a year.
            Then I went to the Information Technology Institute. It was an intensive nine months of programming, and I
            ended up graduating valedictorian.
            Unfortunately, the school was a casualty of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">Dot-com bubble</a> and closed down.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>First Programming Job</h2>
        <p>
            Fresh out of IT boot camp, I landed a job at <a href="https://www.petroweb.com/">petroWEB</a> as a Web
            Developer. Graduating top of my class gave me
            a lot of confidence. I worked hard to learn ASP, but I stopped when I had learned enough to do my job.

        </p>
        <p>
            I was the hacker from George Leonard's Mastery book. I would work hard and do my job, but only my job. I
            didn't push myself. This would be
            my pattern at <a href="https://www.myigetit.com/">I Get It</a> and the <a
                href="https://www.cffp.edu">College for Financial Planning</a> up until 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 10 years I got by on being smart and improvising. In the book, <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/NurtureShock-New-Thinking-About-Children/dp/0446504130">Nurture Shock</a>
            by Po Bronson,
            chapter 1 talked about the "inverse power of praise". My friends and family would tell me how good I was
            with computers. I graduated top
            of my class, work was easy for me. This kind of praise lulled me into a false sense of security. All of that
            crumbled in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first time in my career, I had a chance to work on a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project">Greenfield project</a> with
            a Master Software Craftsman. He wanted to use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>TDD
            </li>
            <li>
                DDD
            </li>
            <li>
                ORM
            </li>

                DI/IoC
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I was completely lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was the shock that I needed to wake me up. This experience got me into Software Craftsmanship, user
            groups, and writing this article.
            It is humbling to describe my journey. It is far from over, but I finally feel like I am on the path to
            mastery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began to read anything I could get my hands on about these topics. You can view my library by visiting my

            I need to remember to pause as I program.
        </p><q>
            If you practice pausing to take inventory even in the middle of actions, the procedure eventually becomes
            automatic, at which point it is so swift it is virtually instantaneous.
            <br />
            Whether you are on the mats or in the middle of everyday routines, time off can be more important than time
            on. You learn to weigh all relevant
            data in your goals and then strategize the best plan to get you where you want to be&mdash;leaving enough
            flexibility, of course, to recalculate
            and restrategize as you flow.

        <h2>First Quality Engineer Job
        </h2>
        <p>
            In January 2014, I was promoted to Quality Engineer. I would tell my friends, "Instead of making stuff, I'm
            breaking stuff." After 17 years as a
            Web developer I was ready to become a tester, but I didn't want to give up programming. So I reinvented
            myself and found that testing was a joy.
            In May 2016 I was promoted to Senior Quality Engineer. My focus was on test automation along with test
            planning and test case management.
        </p>
        <h2>First Product Management Job</h2>
        <p>
            In March 2020, I was promoted to Associate Technology Product Manager. In June 2021, I was promoted again to
            Product Owner. I work alongside an executive director on a student homepage for Kaplan. Her role is to work
            with senior leaders on a roadmap. Then we collaborate with designers and researchers creating the designs
            that the team will work on. I take these designs and create Jira tickets. Then I work with the team in
            refining the tickets. I act as the product owner setting priority and answering questions. As we near the
            release of the feature, I conduct user acceptance testing. After the release I monitor the product to ensure
            things are working in production.
