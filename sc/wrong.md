# Get it Wrong the First Time

By: Dan Stewart\
July 29, 2012 

Don't be so hard on yourself. Go ahead and get it wrong the first time. 
[Make it work, make it right, make it fast.](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)

Getting it wrong the first time is a great way to avoid [getting stuck](https://www.jeffwofford.com/?p=838). 
You just type the first thing that comes to mind. The important thing is that you're typing.

>I'm willing to copy-and-paste to get a test passing, but once the test passes, I can usually remove the duplication quickly.

>Don't be afraid to be wrong. When you don't know what the right design choice is, make a decision and stay principled. If you

>The beauty of software is that nothing is permanent. So we should act like it when deciding what design choices to follow.
